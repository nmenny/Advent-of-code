# Advent of code solutions

This repository contains solutions for the "Advent of Code" event (see the [official page](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) for more information).

The solutions do not contain the input used in order to respect the work of the author. If you want to use the proposed solutions, you can go to the Advent of Code website, get your input, put the input data into a `input.txt` or `input.json` file in the directory containing the code and run the solution with it.

The following events are present in this repository :
* [2015](./2015/README.md)
* [2023](./2023/README.md)
